#sigint
A research assistant to help with online searches. This plugin was created to assist in Soviet history research and early US overflights of the Soviet Union, (ostensibly to gather information, particularly signals/electronic information), therefore the name SIGINT (Signals Intelligence) was chosen. 

Far from being bound to just history reasearch, you can use sigint for all of your online thought-keeping needs.

##Follow the trail
In doing research, it is oftentimes problematic to trace the source of a document, a note, an anecdote, or a bit of information after some time has passed. With sigint, you can create a project, and keep track of your research thread, from inception to closure. 

##Context
Many times, links are woven in as part of a surrounding text, [like so](https://github.com/cjryan/sigint). Long after that link has been bookmarked or written down, it is easy to forget why you saved that link. sigint will allow you to save the surrounding text of a link, as part of your thread.
