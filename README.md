#sigint
A research assistant to help with online searches. This plugin was created to assist in Soviet history research and early US overflights of the Soviet Union, (ostensibly to gather information, particularly signals/electronic information), therefore the name SIGINT (Signals Intelligence) was chosen.

Far from being bound to just history reasearch, you can use sigint for all of your online thought-keeping needs.

##Follow the trail
In doing research, it is oftentimes problematic to trace the source of a document, a note, an anecdote, or a bit of information after some time has passed. With sigint, you can create a project, and keep track of your research thread, from inception to closure. You can also create tags to keep track of your current progress.

##Context
Many times, links are woven in as part of a surrounding text, [like so](https://github.com/cjryan/sigint). Long after that link has been bookmarked or written down, it is easy to forget why you saved that link or what you downloaded from it. sigint will allow you to save the surrounding text of a link, as part of your thread.

Similarly, tabs can be used as to-do lists, resulting in dozens or hundreds of open tabs. Sigint will help save your tabs, links, and research to reduce your browser load.

##Getting Started
First, install the add-on. This can be done either by cloning this repository and building it out, using the Firefox [jpm utility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tutorials/Getting_Started_(jpm)), or by downloading and installing the point release .xpi files on the Releases page (coming soon).

Once the add-on is installed, you can begin to track a topic of your research. Press ctrl-shift-o (or command-shift-o on a Mac), and enter in a topic. From here, all of your links will be saved under this topic, until you change the topic. Pressing ctrl-shift-o will let you see your current topic, or change it to a different one, depending on your research at the moment.

To save a link, press ctrl-alt, and left-click the link at the same time. This will preserve the link, and it's metadata (date/time, referring page, current page, link href attribute, and surrounding text).

To view your collected pages/links for a given topic, press ctrl-shift-l, which will open a new tab for you to view, edit, and annotate your current pages/links.

To view your saved links, press ctrl-shift-l, which will bring up a list of links that you have saved to date under a given topic. From here, click on any one of the links to view its metadata, as well as edit it. You can also add notes in this new edit page to add context or thoughts to any particular link.
